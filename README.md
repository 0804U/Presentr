# Presentr

Presentr is a micro-framework, a simple wrapper on top of the Custom View Controller Presentation API introduced in iOS 8.

It is meant to handle the most typical custom presentations, but it is has been designed so new ones can be added easily.
Just send me a pull request and I will add it.
